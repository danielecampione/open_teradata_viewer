      been installed on the "Schema Browser" menu.
    - Fixed a bug related to the lack of JAR files in the plugins directory;

    - Added the "Paste" command button to the tool bar.

      area.

    - BUG0001 fixed.

    - The animated assistant is disabled by default.
    - The table sorter repaints the result set also with the animated assistant
      actived.

0.05c (25/07/2011)
    X [BUG0003] Although it has been implemented the algorithm to change the
      result set, it is not possible to update the Teradata database because of
      a problem with the relative JDBC driver (wrong selected column index).

0.05a (21/07/2011)
    X [BUG0002] Added an animated assistant that is shown while a process is
      running. Once the animated assistant appears, an infinite loop of
      invocations to the repaint method begins.
    - The "SHOW RECORD" command can be perfomed only if a record has been
      selected.
    - Updated the "EDIT CONNECTION" dialog screenshot in the user manual.

    - Added the user and password text fields for connections that don't use the
      LDAP logging mechanism. 
    - Fixed a bug relative to the "EDIT DRIVERS" command. If a JDBC driver was
      not found and the user closed the drivers dialog box, the returned

0.03c (01/07/2011)
    - Fixed a bug relative to the "SHOW VIEW" command. When the command was
      performed on an object that is not a view, the returned resultset was in
      a null record. Now this situation is suitably managed.

0.03b (29/06/2011)
    - Added the full-screen mode. Added the "Full Screen" menu voice to the
      "View" menu.
